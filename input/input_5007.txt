Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.
Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 °C (58.57 °F), at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.
Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 kilometres (25,000 miles). It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (238,900 mi)—1.28 light seconds—and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon's gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, causes tides and gradually slows Earth's rotation. Tidal locking has made the Moon always face Earth with the same side.
Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed about 4.5 billion years ago from gas and dust in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions.
The name Terra occasionally is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others, while in poetry Tellus has been used to denote personification of the Earth. Terra is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages, languages that evolved from Latin, like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings, like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre.
There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. The word "earthly" is derived from "Earth". From the Latin Terra comes terran, terrestrial, and (via French) terrene, and from the Latin Tellus comes tellurian and telluric.
The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682 Ga (billion years) ago. By 4.54 Ga the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.
Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger. A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth. It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.0 and 3.8 Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.
Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing. Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed. In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity. By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.
As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust. The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 Ga, only 140 Ma after Earth's formation. There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance: (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.
New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750 Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600–540 Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 Ma.
The most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 Ma, and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma. High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years. The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the "last ice age", covered large parts of the continents, to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.
Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.
During the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 539 Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "Snowball Earth", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity. Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones. Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66 Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 Mys, and several million years ago, an African ape species gained the ability to stand upright. This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day.
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%. Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, possibly reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for current plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years. A lack of vegetation would result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making current animal life impossible. Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years. Even if the Sun were stable and eternal, a significant fraction of the water in the modern oceans would descend into the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges as the core of the Earth slowly cools.
The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius. Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized, with the heavier elements sinking to the core of the dying sun.
Earth has a rounded shape, through hydrostatic equilibrium, with an average diameter of 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi), making it the fifth largest planetary sized and largest terrestrial object of the Solar System.
Due to Earth's rotation it has the shape of an ellipsoid, bulging at its equator; its diameter is 43 kilometres (27 mi) longer there than at its poles. Earth's shape also has local topographic variations; the largest local variations, like the Mariana Trench (10,925 metres or 35,843 feet below local sea level), shortens Earth's average radius by 0.17% and Mount Everest (8,848 metres or 29,029 feet above local sea level) lengthens it by 0.14%.[n 6] Since Earth's surface is farthest out from its center of mass at its equatorial bulge, the summit of the volcano Chimborazo in Ecuador (6,384.4 km or 3,967.1 mi) is its farthest point out. Parallel to the rigid land topography the ocean exhibits a more dynamic topography.
To measure the local variation of Earth's topography, geodesy employs an idealized Earth producing a geoid shape. Such a shape is gained if the ocean is idealized, covering Earth completely and without any perturbations such as tides and winds. The result is a smooth but irregular geoid surface, providing a mean sea level as a reference level for topographic measurements.
Earth's surface is the boundary between the atmosphere, and the solid Earth and oceans. Defined in this way, it has an area of about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi). Earth can be divided into two hemispheres: by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres; or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres.
Most of Earth's surface is ocean water: 70.8% or 361 million km2  (139 million sq mi). This vast pool of salty water is often called the world ocean, and makes Earth with its dynamic hydrosphere a water world or ocean world. Indeed, in Earth's early history the ocean may have covered Earth completely. The world ocean is commonly divided into the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Antarctic or Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean, from largest to smallest. The ocean covers Earth's oceanic crust, with the shelf seas covering the shelves of the continental crust to a lesser extent. The oceanic crust forms large oceanic basins with features like abyssal plains, seamounts, submarine volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system. At Earth's polar regions, the ocean surface is covered by seasonally variable amounts of sea ice that often connects with polar land, permafrost and ice sheets, forming polar ice caps.
Earth's land covers 29.2%, or 149 million km2 (58 million sq mi) of Earth's surface. The land surface includes many islands around the globe, but most of the land surface is taken by the four continental landmasses, which are (in descending order): Africa-Eurasia, America (landmass), Antarctica, and Australia (landmass). These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents. The terrain of the land surface varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from a low point of -418 m (-1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).
Land can be covered by surface water, snow, ice, artificial structures or vegetation. Most of Earth's land hosts vegetation, but considerable amounts of land are ice sheets (10%, not including the equally large area of land under permafrost) or deserts (33%)
The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's land surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. Soil is crucial for land to be arable. Earth's total arable land is 10.7% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. Earth has an estimated 16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland.
The land surface and the ocean floor form the top of Earth's crust, which together with parts of the upper mantle form Earth's lithosphere. Earth's crust may be divided into oceanic and continental crust. Beneath the ocean-floor sediments, the oceanic crust is predominantly basaltic, while the continental crust may include lower density materials such as granite, sediments and metamorphic rocks. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the mass of the crust.
Earth's surface topography comprises both the topography of the ocean surface, and the shape of Earth's land surface. The submarine terrain of the ocean floor has an average bathymetric depth of 4 km, and is as varied as the terrain above sea level. Earth's surface is continually being shaped by internal plate tectonic processes including earthquakes and volcanism; by weathering and erosion driven by ice, water, wind and temperature; and by biological processes including the growth and decomposition of biomass into soil.
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth's crust and upper mantle, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur. The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.
As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200 Ma old. By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030 Ma, although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400 Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovicic discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30-50 km for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.
Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core. Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1-0.5° per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed. The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth. The density increases with depth. Among the Solar System's planetary-sized objects, Earth is the object with the highest density.
Earth's mass is approximately 5.97 x 1024 kg (5.970 Yg). It is composed mostly of iron (32.1% by mass), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to gravitational separation, the core is primarily composed of the denser elements: iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements. The most common rock constituents of the crust are oxides. Over 99% of the crust is composed of various oxides of eleven elements, principally oxides containing silicon (the silicate minerals), aluminium, iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, or sodium.
Wikipedia, a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers known as Wikipedians, began with its first edit on 15 January 2001, two days after the domain was registered. It grew out of Nupedia, a more structured free encyclopedia, as a way to allow easier and faster drafting of articles and translations.
The technological and conceptual underpinnings of Wikipedia predate this; the earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by Rick Gates in 1993, and the concept of a free-as-in-freedom online encyclopedia (as distinct from mere open source) was proposed by Richard Stallman in 1998.
Stallman's concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing. This contrasted with contemporary digital encyclopedias such as Microsoft Encarta and Encyclopædia Britannica. In 2001, the license for Nupedia was changed to GFDL, and Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia as a complementary project, using an online wiki as a collaborative drafting tool.
While Wikipedia was initially imagined as a place to draft articles and ideas for eventual polishing in Nupedia, it quickly overtook its predecessor, becoming both draft space and home for the polished final product of a global project in hundreds of languages, inspiring a wide range of other online reference projects.
In 2014, Wikipedia had approximately 495 million monthly readers. In 2015, according to comScore, Wikipedia received over 115 million monthly unique visitors from the United States alone. In September 2018, the projects saw 15.5 billion monthly page views.
The use of volunteers was integral in making and maintaining Wikipedia. However, even without the internet, huge complex projects of similar nature had made use of volunteers. Specifically, the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary was conceived with the speech at the London Library, on Guy Fawkes Day, 5 November 1857, by Richard Chenevix Trench. It took about 70 years to complete. Dr. Trench envisioned a grand new dictionary of every word in the English language, and to be used democratically and freely. According to author Simon Winchester, "The undertaking of the scheme, he said, was beyond the ability of any one man. To peruse all of English literature – and to comb the London and New York newspapers and the most literate of the magazines and journals – must be instead 'the combined action of many.' It would be necessary to recruit a team – moreover, a huge one – probably comprising hundreds and hundreds of unpaid amateurs, all of them working as volunteers."
There was some hesitation among editors about binding Nupedia too closely to a wiki-style workflow. After a Nupedia wiki was launched under nupedia.com on 10 January 2001, Wales proposed launching the new project under its own name, and Sanger proposed Wikipedia, framing it as "a supplementary project to Nupedia which operates entirely independently." A new wiki was launched at wikipedia.com on Monday 15 January 2001. The bandwidth and server (located in San Diego) used for these initial projects were donated by Bomis. Many former Bomis employees later contributed content to the encyclopedia: notably Tim Shell, co-founder and later CEO of Bomis, and programmer Jason Richey.
Wales stated in December 2008 that he made Wikipedia's first edit, a test edit with the text "Hello, World!", but this may have been to an old version of Wikipedia which soon after was scrapped and replaced by a restart. The first recovered edit to Wikipedia.com was to the HomePage on 15 January 2001, reading "This is the new WikiPedia!"; it can be found here. The existence of the project was formally announced and an appeal for volunteers to engage in content creation was made to the Nupedia mailing list on 17 January 2001.
In March 2002, following the withdrawal of funding by Bomis during the dot-com bust, Sanger left both Nupedia and Wikipedia. By 2002, he and Wales differed in their views on how best to manage open encyclopedias. Both still supported the open-collaboration concept, but they disagreed on how to handle disruptive editors, specific roles for experts, and the best way to guide the project to success.
Wales went on to establish self-governance and bottom-up self-direction by editors on Wikipedia. He made it clear that he would not be involved in the community's day-to-day management, but would encourage it to learn to self-manage and find its own best approaches. As of 2007, Wales mostly restricted his role to occasional input on serious matters, executive activity, advocacy of knowledge, and encouragement of similar reference projects.
Sanger said he is an "inclusionist" and is open to almost anything, and proposed that experts still have a place in the Web 2.0 world. In 2006 he founded Citizendium, an open encyclopedia that used real names for contributors to reduce disruptive editing, and hoped to facilitate "gentle expert guidance" to increase the accuracy of its content. Decisions about article content were to be up to the community, but the site was to include a statement about "family-friendly content".

Hi, my name is Kathleen, and I am going to be blogging about music! I really love music and it has impacted my life in so many ways that I would have never imagined such a broad, yet general, yet subjective matter could cover it all!
I think that music is something that everyone can enjoy. It has something for everyone and there are so many ways to access it that honestly, sometimes I wonder how people do not know more about it. For example, you do not even have to look for the most popular music, or the “coolest” artist. Even just humming your own tune is like connecting to other people through a collective creativity. This is beautiful because we do not all need to listen to the popular stuff, the cool stuff, or emulate the cool rock stars, the “popular” kids, or the “indie” kids, etc. I do not like those stereotypes because I believe that they keep people outside of the music community by saying that you must enjoy a certain type of music to be interesting and recognized within the community.
While it is somewhat true that you need to be famous or successful in order to make a living from music, you need to be able to be different and stand out. I think that people should not feel pressure to be famous and make an abundance of money. Music can be your livelihood and pay your bills, as for famous people. But it can also be a hobby or a passion, too.  And there's nothing wrong with keeping a passion to yourself. So, if you feel pressured to be famous and have all this luck and success from your music, I believe you do not need to feel that way. I am saying that from firsthand experience…
During the pandemic, while I was in online school, I went through a patch of hyper-fixating on those super successful, young musicians. They were the same age as me! I was honestly jealous of them. But over time, I realized that they also had a spur of luck. I told myself that their luck was going to be mine—that all I was missing was that luck. I was going to do everything in my power to get that luck and get to that place where they were. And maybe I was hazy from online school taking up my life, or maybe it was also childish behavior that fed into these ideas. But I also think that if you’re a musician and have a passion for music, you will probably feel the pressure of success at some point. And I feel for people who feel that way because it is not just for music. It is for anything. People feel that their only salvation is to be famous. If you are trying to pay the bills, that may be true. But you can still perform even if it can't fully support you financially. You can still meet new people and grow your passion without it having to be your full-time job. There is another side of music, the more wholesome side, wherein you make music and participate in the music community just for the sake of doing it. And this is the idea I want to cultivate with this blog, starting with a conversation about one of my favorite bands, Vulfpeck.
A while ago, my band teacher told me that he was playing in a church later that week and that he was performing a song by a funk band called Vulfpeck. He played me one of the songs by the band, and I was immediately intrigued. I had never heard of this band before nor heard the song, and it was amazing. The song was called “Christmas in L.A.,” with the lead singer being Theo Katzman. I was blown away by the tightness of the band. They were so connected and well-coordinated. Vulfpeck really emulates the wholesomeness of the music community. They add so many intricate details, for instance—in one song—bells, to make each song intriguing. Their music is a dreamy and upbeat escape that snaps you into a haven of funk. I have been opened to a whole world of their music filled with impactful, slow, meaningful, emotional and all-around beautiful songs. And there are also some songs—songs that are almost humorous like one called “Funky Duck," or one called “It Gets Funkier." Their humorous attitude towards their playing is also really inspiring. In the music video for one of their songs, "Birds of a Feather," their band leader, Jack Stratton, is playing pancakes and hitting them with spatulas instead of drumsticks. It is hilarious! You can tell that they have a lighthearted attitude towards their music, and this is something I want to emulate. The songs are a great escape when I am feeling down or if I want to celebrate my happiness. I do not think I will stop listening to them anytime soon—they’re great!
I hope that my discussion of some of the aspects of the music community as well as the band Vulfpeck has inspired something in you, or changed your perspective, or introduced you to something new. Please enjoy this video of me playing a cover of the song I mentioned, "Christmas in L.A.," and have a great day!
I’m Jeff, a now old man based in Palm Springs, California, who’s just a wannabe DJ - of my own radio station! Not previously having an outlet to express my passion for music, one day a friend suggested that I create a music blog. After giving it a bit of thought, I decided to do just that in the summer of 2015.
I first became interested in music before I started kindergarten, when I listened to my much older brother’s rock’n’roll records and my parents’ Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and Dean Martin records and musical & movie soundtracks. By my teens, I was obsessed with music and song lists and would listen to the various San Francisco Bay Area radio stations’ weekly Top 30 countdowns, as well as the legendary Kasey Kasem’s Weekly Top 40, and have been a music freak ever since. (Some friends would place the emphasis on “freak”). My music tastes are very eclectic – my favorites are classic and alternative rock, soul, R&B, funk, 80’s punk and new wave, dream pop and classical, but I also like hard rock, metal, death metal, grunge, folk rock, pop, EDM, synth-pop, Brit-pop, hip-hop, some rap, blues and light jazz.
Each week I post my Top 30 favorite songs, and occasionally post lists of favorite songs for a specific year or decade, or a particular theme of interest. I enjoy discovering and supporting indie artists and bands, so I write reviews of their music or articles about them to help promote them to a wider audience. Also, I occasionally share interesting articles or commentaries written by others about the music industry, as well as music videos I really like.
I hope readers will enjoy my posts, and comments are always welcome.
I started this blog in August of 2005 on a whim. Never could I have expected it to become such an important part of my life, both personally and professionally. In fact, for the first few years of blogging, I kept my identity here firmly hidden because I was sure the blog would remain nothing more than a little passion project. It is nearly impossible to remember what online life was really like in those days, but I'll always treasure the feeling of utter bliss of discovery and kinship I stumbled upon when I started blogging and found an entire community of like-minded people right on the other side of this screen. 
It is hard to quantify what this blog means to me, though if we're talking numbers, there are nearly 900 posts and almost 30,000 comments collected here. Thanks to The Wednesday Chef, I have written two books and have another on the way. I wrote a monthly food column for several years. I have made countless connections and friends for life. The person I used to be is captured here for posterity, as are the memories and sensations of my former life in New York and the early years of my life back in Berlin. This is the closest I ever came to keeping a real diary. Not only are many of my favorite and most beloved recipes gathered here, but so are countless dear and tender memories, like summers in Italy over the years, the wobbly transition from New York to Berlin, the early years of life with children, and the transformation I made from blogger to book author. Now it's time for me to finally put up the "Closed for Business" sign here, though the archives of The Wednesday Chef will stay on for as long as I have any say in the matter. 
You can subscribe to my newsletter Letter from Berlin at Substack now, either for free or with a couple varieties of paying options. Your support enables me to continue making a creative life. In the newsletter, I share recipes, of course, as well as deeper thoughts on books I'm reading, essays about family life and creativity, and inside peeks at the process of writing another cookbook. We can still connect in the comments there and I look forward to continuing the conversation we've been having for almost 18 years now.
I am deeply grateful to everyone who ever followed a link to find me online. You allowed me to make my dreams of being a writer become a reality. You have read along here and commented with wisdom and care and affection. You have come to my readings and events and bought my books and cooked my recipes. And you have connected to the stories I've told about the important people in my life and blessed me with your interest and kindness and appetite.
I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life, cooking dinner usually meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from a box. It wasn’t until I got married that I started eating real food because I married a guy who cooks. I started joining him in the kitchen and realized that cooking could be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And gaining confidence as a home chef? That was life changing!
I'm David Leiter, the guy behind this website. I'm an American who's been traveling the world full time for 9 years now.
I started this travel blog in 2019 to document my own international trips, share my photos, and help others learn how to travel the world and find some really good spots off the beaten path.
All of the writing and pictures on this site come from my own personal experience.
I'm currently based in Bali, Indonesia, where I met my wife Intan, who’s a Bali local. Now she joins me on these adventures too.
Together, we've done some bucket list hikes, climbed active volcanoes, seen exotic wildlife, and visited some spectacular castles, temples, and monuments around the world.
I've worked with and been featured by BBC Travel, NBC News, Time, and other companies.
I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list. I hope this world travel blog can help and inspire you in your own journeys as well!
Common Corpus makes it possible to train LLMs on truly open data, leading to auditable models and a more democratized LLM ecosystem. This new dataset meets the highest levels of compliance. By providing clear provenance and using permissibly licensed data, Common Corpus exceeds the requirements of even the strictest regulations on AI training data, such as the EU AI Act. Pleias has also taken extensive steps to ensure GDPR compliance, by developing custom procedures to enable personally identifiable information (PII) removal for multilingual data. This makes Common Corpus an ideal foundation for secure, enterprise-grade models. Models trained on Common Corpus will be resilient to an increasingly regulated industry.
As it stands, open data is limited for English; however, even for relatively high-resource languages like French and German, the open data landscape is far worse. It is important to be developing datasets for a wide variety of languages to reduce the over-reliance of English in LLM development in order to broaden access and increase equity surrounding the economic benefits that accompany language technologies like LLMs. Common Corpus primarily contains English and French data, but there is a significant amount of data in German, Spanish, Italian, and other European languages.
Common Corpus is composed of five main sub-corpora: OpenGovernment, OpenCulture,  OpenScience, OpenWeb, and OpenSource. Each of these is distinct in style, content, and quality and comes from varied sources. The result is a diverse dataset suitable for training a general-purpose model.
OpenGovernment contains Finance Commons, a dataset of financial documents from a range of governmental and regulatory bodies. Finance Commons is a multimodal dataset, including both text and PDF corpora. OpenGovernment also contains Legal Commons, a dataset of legal and administrative texts. OpenCulture contains cultural heritage data like books and newspapers. Many of these texts come from the 18th and 19th centuries, or even earlier. 
OpenScience data primarily comes from publicly available academic and scientific publications, which are most often released as PDFs. OpenWeb contains datasets from YouTube Commons, a dataset of transcripts from public domain YouTube videos, and websites like Stack Exchange. Finally, OpenSource comprises code collected from GitHub repositories which were permissibly licensed. 
Ensuring high data quality is important as it has been shown to positively impact model performance. Curation for Common Corpus is unlike that for web data like Common Crawl, which primarily entails deduplication and text quality filtering. There are well-established tools and procedures for this, especially for English, for which there is the most web data. Pleias has taken an individualized approach to curating each dataset, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution to ensuring high-quality training data. Each sub-corpus in Common Corpus was filtered and curated using a different combination of procedures.
OpenCulture required multiple curation steps. First was correcting digitization errors. Most of these texts were scanned and digitized with Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which often leaves mistakes and unwanted digitization artifacts. Pleias created a suite of custom tools for this dataset, including an OCR correction model, OCRonos-Vintage, which Pleias trained from scratch and have made publicly available. At 124 million parameters, it runs on CPU and GPU. As a small model, it has an extremely high throughput, making it efficient when running at scale. It is able to accurately fix incorrect spacing, replace incorrect words, and generally correct broken text structures. This step is essential for using data that is the result of public digitization efforts, which were the source of most of the cultural heritage data. 
As the OpenCulture texts are mainly historical, some of the texts contain toxic or harmful content, because social norms have changed drastically, especially surrounding language used to describe minoritized groups. Pleias developed a pipeline for reducing the amount of toxic content in the dataset, which is described in a recently published preprint about, where there is expanded discussion about the motivation and method used. The key component of the pipeline is the toxicity classifier developed to specifically handle the unique features of the dataset: historical, multilingual data with OCR errors. Pleias also released the training data and the code for the classifier. To curate OpenCulture, toxicity ratings from the classifier to identify extremely harmful content and then it was removed or transformed via synthetic rewriting. The resulting dataset has a greatly reduced potential for societal harm, while not compromising textual quality or dataset size. This is an ongoing research area at Pleias, with the goal of continuing to develop safe and fair models and datasets. 
Datasets derived from PDF, such as the data in OpenScience, were not created by simply extracting plain text, as this loses important contextual and stylistic information about the structure of the text, such as headings. Instead, using a vision-language model (VLM), the structure and layouts of the PDFs were parsed, then the text was extracted in a way that is sensitive to the layout and formatting of each document.
The natural language data was filtered for quality similar to the approach used by FineWeb, where content with low educational content was removed. For the code dataset, however, there was a multi-step approach. First, key programming languages were identified. Files in other programming languages and data files were removed. Then code segments were annotated using an existing tool, ArmoRM, which uses features such as complexity, style, and explanation to score code quality. All code that fell below the 20th percentile in quality rating was removed.
The resulting dataset is unlike other open datasets, which are composed in large part of web data. Common Corpus is composed of books, newspapers, scientific articles, government and legal documents, code, and more. This can help develop models which have generalizable capabilities for a wide variety of tasks. For example, the inclusion of scientific and legal documents is intended to increase world knowledge of LLMs trained on this corpus and increase factual outputs. Code data can be used not only to train code-generation models, but has been shown to improve reasoning capabilities for natural language generation. 
In terms of developing models with users in mind, Common Corpus is well-suited to train models for creative composition. In an analysis of one million user interactions with ChatGPT, researchers found that 30% of user requests related to generating creative writing, including fictional story or poetry generation. However, training on creative writing data, such as book text, is difficult, primarily due to legal reasons. Some of the largest AI industry players have been sued for their unauthorized use of books and journalistic material that is protected by copyright. One of the largest open book corpora, Books3, was taken down by anti-piracy groups, making the availability of creative writing content even more limited. OpenCulture contains significant numbers of books and periodicals in at least ten languages, all of which are in the public domain. This allows for the legal training of LLMs to generate creative texts in a variety of languages. Furthermore, as context windows are growing larger, long-context data will increasingly be the bottleneck for developing powerful language models. Book data in OpenCulture are well-suited to this.
Common Corpus also includes multimodal data. PDFs from administrative or academic domains contain rich structured data and high-quality text. These multimodal data allow for the development of practical tools and applications for document processing, which have applications for administrative contexts, but also lead to the development of more and better datasets. 
Common Corpus contributes to the growing ecosystem of open datasets, including Dolma from Ai2 and FineWeb from HuggingFace. Common Corpus diversifies the languages and domains represented in the open data landscape, which helps everyone train better models. The complete dataset is available on HuggingFace: at https://huggingface.co/datasets/PleIAs/common_corpus. Pleias is also releasing a complete technical report, describing the full details about the curation and filtering procedures used, as well as the complete provenance of all of the data. Additionally, the sub-corpora will be released individually in the coming weeks.
As popular as they are, large language models rely on the training datasets they learn on. LLMs consist of multiple hidden layers of deep neural networks, which extract and train their parameters from a significant amount of data sources.  If you train LLMs with questionable datasets, they will be impacted by performance issues like bias and overfitting. Conversely, training a deep learning model with high-quality datasets enables a more accurate and coherent output.
Leading organizations have realized that good language modeling needs more than state-of-the-art machine learning models and training methods. Curating and annotating a diverse training dataset that fairly represents the model’s domain is equally important in implementing neural network artificial intelligence solutions in various industries.
For example, Bloomberg trained a transformer architecture from scratch with decades-worth of carefully curated financial data. The resulting BloombergGPT allows the financial company to empower its clients and perform existing financial-specific NLP tasks faster and with more accuracy. Likewise, HuggingFace has developed a programmer-friendly model StarCode, by training it on code in different programming languages gathered from GitHub.
Machine learning teams face considerable challenges when curating datasets to train AI models. For example,
Data scarcity in some domains results in imbalanced datasets that affect the model’s ability to infer appropriately. Similarly, preparing a diverse dataset proves challenging in certain use cases.
Training a large language model requires an enormous size of datasets. For example, OpenAI trained GPT-3 with 45 TB of textual data curated from various sources.
Organizations must secure datasets containing sensitive information from adversarial threats to protect users’ privacy and comply with industry regulations.
Data annotation is required when fine-tuning LLMs for downstream tasks. When performed manually, organizations must manage the cost of hiring large teams of human labelers and factor in possible annotation errors.
Data labeling platforms like Kili Technology help organizations overcome hurdles when preparing datasets for machine learning projects. Our software provides automated labeling tools that improve annotation efficiency and reduce the number of human-generated errors.

Rewind to when the pandemic first began. Isolation became our way of life, and confusion and helplessness were our norm. I remember thinking about how hard it must especially be for those who live alone.
I am a child abuse survivor. Anyone who reads my blog now knows that painful fact about me. What you may not know is that this personal and traumatic life experience caused a snowball effect. I thought about others who are child abuse survivors, and how they were no longer able to seek outside support due to quarantining. My heart broke for people who were struggling alone. I decided to look up child abuse foundations and ask if there was a way I could help.
I came across foundations looking for writers to share their personal life and experiences. I have always loved writing, and I have written poetry from the time I was a child as an outlet for the pain I have felt. I decided to submit my story about the importance of awareness to two of these foundations.
The feedback I received warmed my heart and made me feel like I was helping others to not feel alone. At the same time, I felt that by sharing my story I was taking control of my life. I cannot change what happened to me. However, if I can bring comfort to others, then something good can come from the unimaginable.
I continue to contribute regularly to these amazing organizations.  I wanted to do my part to break the stigma regarding those topics, and the only way I could do so was by example. As a result, I decided to start blogging so I could spread awareness about trauma and mental wellness. This branched into also sharing about what I’ve learned from my relationships and from parenting my daughter.
I mentioned in prior posts that I have Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), and that I would discuss it more fully in another post. I now feel it is the time to do so. For most of my life I didn’t even know what C-PTSD was, or that I had it. Although it is not officially diagnosed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), it is related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is recognized by the DSM-5, and it is caused by extreme fear due to a traumatic event. Symptoms include flashbacks, hypervigilance, and avoidance of things associated with the trauma. C-PTSD is also caused by trauma; however, it is caused by repeated or prolonged trauma. 
My mother also vacillated between loving me and wanting nothing to do with me.  Other forms of trauma were her making me believe that it was my job to take care of her emotional needs in order to feel safe and loved. Growing up with no sense of safety, support, or love caused me to view the world as a very scary place and for me to feel frightened all the time. If you want to read more about my story of abuse, you can read about it here.
My symptoms of C-PTSD include having nightmares about what happened to me, watching something on TV or reading something that causes me to emotionally flashback to my trauma (I don’t visualize it, but I feel the sadness caused from it), and negative self-perception. Additionally, I used to have a distorted perception of my abuser, as I felt completely dependent on her. I still struggle with emotional regulation because certain things trigger me. When I get triggered, I feel completely panic stricken and helpless, just as I did when I was a child. Although I remember most of what happened to me as a child, there are some things I don’t fully remember. Having gaps in your memory or blocking things out entirely is another symptom of C-PTSD (healthline.com, 2018).
My biggest symptom is my ongoing struggle with anxiety. My autonomic nervous system is overactive due to my prolonged and intense trauma. In other words, I am hyperalert and in “flight or fight” mode, feeling continuous anxiety (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 2020). I have written numerous blog posts about the physical and emotional symptoms of anxiety, the types of anxiety disorders, and two different articles filled with various strategies and tips to manage anxiety in adults and children.
These personal experiences are not easy to write about. It is not easy to write about having C-PTSD. In fact, I have broken down after writing many of my blog posts, specifically the ones about going no contact with my mom, my relationship with my inner child, and my story of abuse. I am taking wounds that will never fully close and reopening them by pouring my emotional pain onto the computer screen. Despite what many have thought, it does not give me closure or help with my healing because I write from the heart. To do so, I must fully connect with the words I am typing.  In some ways, that means I experience it again.
I want to show the world that scars do not have to be present to be felt. In fact, the scars left by emotional and mental abuse may be invisible, but that does not mean they are not potent. They cause immeasurable damage to the minds and souls of those who experience it.  It is much harder to prove emotional and mental abuse, let alone have someone intervene. This type of abuse will continue unless there is more awareness. With every story I tell, my hope is that one person gains awareness. If one person now understands, perhaps one child won’t have to experience that trauma.
That is where hope comes into play. Hope. It is a word that I have clung to my entire life. Hope allowed me to keep going during my childhood. I would tell myself that maybe if I was hurting, that meant somewhere out there one child wasn’t being abused.  Albeit unrealistic, it was my hope that my pain was sparing someone else. That hope brought comfort to something that no child should ever endure.
I started blogging about my personal life and experiences, and I will continue to do so, because I want to spread hope. I want people to know that no matter what you have endured, no matter how broken and alone you feel, there is always hope. There is so much that can be taken away from each of us, so much pain can be inflicted upon us, but hope is the one thing that is ours. Even in our darkest moments, even when we feel the world has turned its back on us, hold onto hope. Hope is what brings us out of the darkness and into the light.
Hope that you matter and your story matters. Hope that you can rise no matter how many times life has thrown you down. Hope that you can heal. Hope that you have survived and will continue to survive no matter how hard life may be. Hope that you will remember to feel hope even on the days you feel like giving up.
I never thought I would start a blog. Yet here I am blogging my life story. I appreciate every person who has reached out to me with their personal stories or to let me know that my words brought them comfort and hope. To each of you, thank you. You inspire me to keep blogging and to keep sharing.

One Piece is simply the gold standard for how to write a long-running anime. Each saga is its own confined epic, and the variety from saga to saga is just brilliant. The characters are simply phenomenal, with interactions that make them seem real. The emotional beats are hit every single time, and no form of art has ever made me cry as much as One Piece has.
While a lot of people who haven't seen or read One Piece like to say that it's just a classic "I wanna be the best" story, with Luffy's goal being to become the Pirate King, the concept of the Pirate King and what it takes to become one plays beautifully into the lore of the world, global politics, power dynamics, and what it means to truly be free. Above all else, One Piece is an adventure, and it takes you with it.
Death Note is a Japanese television drama anime series based on the manga series of the same name by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. The show is centered around Light Yagami - a promising highschooler and aspiring detective with a strong sense of "justice".
The Promised Neverland undoubtedly had one of the best plot twists in anime, which was revealed at the end of the first episode in the adoption of the little girl Conny, which shocked viewers and introduced the protagonists.
Another is a horror anime with one of the best plot twists, which was built throughout the episodes and finally revealed at the end, which is about the true identity of the extra student, who surprised everyone who was watching and the characters in the story.
Magic Madoka, is a dark fantasy anime, which had a sensational plot in relation to the witch's jewels and in relation to the kyubbey, which in reality was much darker than it looked, without a doubt a great plot twist for both viewers and for the characters of the plot.
Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime with great plot twists, such as the traitors, the truth about the titans, about the Reeis, which surprised the viewers of the anime when they revealed the truth, without a doubt an anime with very good plots.
Wonder Egg Priority, although it has some plot holes, has a great plot twist at the end, in relation to Frill, the egg girls and the animals of the protagonists that surprised viewers with such cruelty, without a doubt a good plot, it just should have a better finish.
Chainsaw Man has a simply sensational plot in relation to the main villain that surprises the viewer with such cruelty and manipulation throughout the anime, a very good plot.
Bungou Stray Dogs has several good plots, even at the beginning of the anime about the protagonist, which gave some indications, but still surprised a lot of people.
Fumetsu is an anime that surprises us even in the first episodes, with the boy with no name and later with the little girl March, an anime with good plots twits.
Made in Abyss is an anime that surprised a lot of people in 2017, it seemed to be a cute anime, but it hid a dark truth about the abyss, a great plot twist
And let's go from Little Witch Academia, another 2017 anime that surprised a lot of people with its big plot twist about the dark truth about the Shiny Chariot show, a very good plot.
Of the many reasons we play video games, the idea of playing one to experience its story is still probably the strangest motivation for those still largely unfamiliar with the medium. Obviously, the idea that games don’t (or can’t) tell compelling stories is an antiquated notion that is slowly fading from the public consciousness. Yet, you sometimes get the feeling that more people are coming around to the idea that video game stories can be great rather than the realization that there are countless video game stories that are already definitively great.
If you are reading this, there is a good chance you don’t need to be told that great video game stories have existed for nearly as long as video games themselves. Yet, there are times when it feels necessary to stop and really appreciate what diverse, essential, and, more often than not, unique stories gaming has granted us over the years
That’s what this list really is. We assigned a panel of Den of Geek contributors the impossible task of voting on the best video game stories ever not as a way to say that there are only 35 great ones but to celebrate the fact that even the best of the best only tell such a small part of the story.
The original Psychonauts was a fantastic little summer camp romp full of memorable characters and levels. And honestly, fans would have been perfectly happy if the sequel had trodden similar ground. 
There’s plenty in Psychonauts 2 for fans of the original (including even better illustrations of various mental health conditions), but Psychonauts 2 also features a surprisingly heartfelt story about the power of family. Yes, there’s plenty of Double Fine’s trademark ridiculousness and exaggerated art style, but in the end, Psychonauts 2 manages to tell a more emotional story than many grounded games that trade in similar themes.
The Yakuza series premiered on the PlayStation 2 in 2005 and introduced players to characters such as Kazuma Kiryu, Goro Majima, and many more. However, it implied history that fans never got to see until 2015. The wait was worth it.
Yakuza 0 gives players a look at the early days of series mainstays Kiryu and Majima and how they became the yakuza legends in earlier entries. Their stories play out like a Godfather-esque crime drama, full of backstabbing and codes of honor. but spiced with action sequences that wouldn’t be out of place in an anime. Moreover, Yakuza 0’s world is full of side stories that inject a good amount of levity to balance out the drama.
Yakuza 0’s pacing doesn’t quite match its action, but when the story gets going, you’re going to want to see more.
Dead Space, with its oodles of classic sci-fi references, takes place after a Lovecraftian variation on the events of 2001: A Space Odyssey has already begun to reshape humanity into something terrible. 
The game excels in positioning us close to protagonist Isaac Clarke, looking over his shoulder like a worried angel, watching as his life is torn apart by horrors birthed from the darkness of an unknown universe. An immersive heads-up display deepens our connection to Clarke as he faces a gauntlet of terrors and tragedies that gradually crack his sanity. Full of tantalizing, legitimately scary lore, Dead Space is as classic a horror story for the video game set as Alien was for movie buffs.
In many modern open-world games, the narrative is little more than a means to an end. The story is primarily there to provide an incentive for the player to explore the game world. But in Ghost of Tsushima, the story of Jin Sakai is inextricably enmeshed with the titular, war-torn island. He worships the soil he’s forced to spill blood on, and this synergy between story and gameplay is what makes the game feel so artful and cohesive.
Jin’s journey poses some deep psychological questions about honor and loyalty in a way that’s more sophisticated and philosophical than what we’re used to seeing in such games. The folks at Sucker Punch clearly poured their hearts and souls into this soulful samurai epic.
Braid is the story of a boy and a girl. A princess goes missing and a boy must rescue her. Taken on its own, that’s not necessarily a great narrative. There’s a reason that Super Mario Bros. isn’t on this list. 
Of course, those who played Braid know that the boy is actually something of a monster who has fashioned himself into the hero of his own narrative. Or maybe the whole thing is really an elaborate metaphor for the story of Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb. However you view it, Braid is a masterclass in subversion. Maybe it’s challenging the tired tropes of an entire medium, or maybe it is simply forcing us to confront the biases that participating in a narrative naturally forms. At the very least, Braid helped prove that truly great gaming narratives weren’t limited to big-budget cinematic experiences and traditional epics.
As the story of a fire lookout forced to wander the woods early into his new job, the power of Firewatch is found in its purity and focus. Henry and Delilah’s walkie-talkie banter is some of the best-written video game dialogue ever, and the mystery they unravel together is made all the more compelling by their emotional, long-distance connection. 
What makes the story so rich is that the longing to see these two meet in person is palpable throughout, with the inherent isolation of their jobs as fire lookouts becoming more oppressive as the story progresses. The conversations with Delilah become so enthralling that, at the point in the game where you lose contact for an extended period of time, the radio silence is almost unbearable.
As great as the Legend of Zelda series is, its stories too often boil down to “Link saves Hyrule from Ganon.” But the complete absence of Hyrule and Link’s archnemesis is exactly why Majora’s Mask has left such a lasting impression. 
From the opening moments, Majora’s Mask just so perfectly creates feelings of dread and impending doom. A grinning moon hangs above as a constant reminder that the world will end in 72 hours no matter what Link does. At least until he goes back in time to reset the timeline. While it’s become more popular for games to embrace time loops and doomsday scenarios like this, Majora’s Mask was among the very first to do so, and arguably still the best.
While Final Fantasy 7 catapulted the series into the mainstream, it started a trend that saw Final Fantasy games pivot away from the fantasy genre. Final Fantasy 9 was envisioned as a return to form for the series that didn’t lose all the lessons Square had learned in storytelling through recent entries.
In Final Fantasy tradition, Final Fantasy 9 stars a host of characters from different backgrounds, and much of the story revolves around them. Almost every character is relatable in one form or another, and players get to see them grow and develop, not just through the main story but also through optional cutscenes that add to their layers. Arguably the best characters in Final Fantasy 9 are Zidane, Steiner, Garnet, and Vivi, not just because of their personalities but because their backstories play key, and unique, parts in the main narrative.
Final Fantasy 9 demonstrates that sometimes the only story a game needs is the story of the characters who lead it.
Many playable characters in military-themed video games are portrayed as heroes, but Spec Ops: The Line asks “What would happen if the protagonist was just as bad as the villain?” Is the player just as guilty for taking their side?
In Spec Ops: The Line, players control Captain Martin Walker in a version of Dubai that is being obliterated by sandstorms. What begins as an extraction mission to retrieve the AWOL Colonel John Konrad devolves into a fight for survival as loyalties are tested and sanities are questioned. The narrative itself is a powerful deconstruction of war, and the gameplay accentuates that with its intentionally military shooter stylings. Whether Spec Ops: The Line lets players decide who to kill or forces gamers’ hands, every decision feels like the wrong one. This style of storytelling reaches a peak during the game’s infamous white phosphorus scene.
It’s one thing to tell a great story, but it’s quite another accomplishment to use seemingly boilerplate action gameplay design as the basis for a medium challenging exploration of morality.
Metal Gear Solid 3 is sometimes described as one of the more straightforward MGS stories and…well, I suppose that’s true. At the very least, it’s not the meta-storytelling-fuelled social commentary head-trip that MGS 2 was, and it doesn’t quite rival MGS 4 when it comes to cutscenes that are the length of a short film. 
Yet, there is so much heart to this story. All the classic Kojima creativity (and, let’s face it, weirdness) is present and accounted for, but this is also an almost Apocalypse Now-like narrative about soldiers weighing duty against the humanity they so often need to sacrifice to carry out that duty. It also tells a genuinely fascinating conspiracy thriller narrative that doubles as one of the most important pieces of one of gaming’s most complicated mythologies.
Final Fantasy 12‘s Ivalice is as diverse, beautiful, and troubled by politics as Westeros. It’s a time of high magic when a murderous power struggle turns the Dalmascan princess Ashe into a vengeful rebel, though the kingdom’s commoners, like Vaan, mostly see the same hungry streets as before. 
It’s a twist of fate that makes these worlds converge, and it’s one that gradually reveals a story about the power of free will, with its ability to make hateful immortals resort to controlling beings they consider lesser. It’s a complicated story to summarize, but fine pacing and one of the best localizations the franchise has ever enjoyed ensures it all makes sense by the time the final boss music starts. 
Roguelikes, with their procedural nature and chaotic playstyle, usually aren’t the best vehicles for complicated, richly emotional stories. Supergiant Games said “bet” while developing Hades, which uses its often murderously short playthroughs to weave a story about family and all the secrets and pain relatives can hide from each other. 
It draws, naturally, from Greek mythology, but with an empathetic understanding and a delve into near-forgotten lore. It’s also beautiful to behold, even when we’ve gotten our hero killed yet again. The story is doled out so efficiently that we become as eager as Zagreus to throw ourselves back into the fray, all to learn more about another fraught family tie and the noble futility of a Sisyphean task.
In the ‘90s, RPGs still largely followed a traditional formula where a party of heroes gathered together to save the world. Final Fantasy VI largely begins that way (albeit with some fantastic set pieces and world-building along the way). But just when you think you’re in for another by-the-numbers (if incredibly well done) adventure, something very unexpected happens; the bad guy wins. And he wins big, essentially triggering the end of the world. He has his reasons, mind you, but he largely did it because he realized he can.
The rest of the game is then spent exploring the ruins of that world, again gathering your forces, and this time, preparing for the true epic final showdown. Above all, Final Fantasy VI is a game about hope in the face of insurmountable odds, and its famous twist illustrates that points so well that it remains, arguably, the very best story in the series.
RPG stories are only ever as good as the cast of characters that drive them, and the party of misfits you assemble in Mass Effect 2 is one of the greatest in gaming history. 
Each party member has a compelling backstory and introduces a unique dynamic to the group. Yes, the overarching sci-fi narrative is great on its own, but it’s the party members’ individual stories, which play out in the game’s uniformly fantastic “loyalty missions,” that make this game so unforgettable and endlessly replayable. Each character’s arc (from Jacob’s shocking reunion with his father to Grunt’s rite of passage into the Urdnot clan, to the heart-wrenching trial of Tali) is incredibly compelling and drags you deeper and deeper into the game’s worlds to the point of obsession.
A handful of rheumy JRPG tropes cause Persona 5 to occasionally stumble over its earnest themes, but it never detracts from the result. Our hero, codenamed Joker, becomes ensnared in a supernatural fight to free the chained hearts of Tokyo from the restrictive social norms that allow the powerful, ensconced in their metaphorical palaces, to prey on them. 
Persona games always have something big to say, and this one understands that individuality is the key to Japan’s future. With a slate of personae that includes more trickster archetypes than normal, including Arsene Lupin himself, Persona 5’s passionate storytelling makes us forget that we’ve yet again fallen in love with a plucky crew of high school kids.
If Red Dead Redemption was The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, Rio Bravo, and High Noon then Red Dead Redemption 2 is McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Deadwood, and Blood Meridian. It is a slow and methodical examination and deconstruction of the Western genre that seems equally fascinated and horrified by what that era represents and the stories we tell in it. 
Yes, Arthur Morgan’s story leads into the events of Red Dead Redemption, but it’s tough to think of this game as “just” a prequel. It’s the story of desperation and the men (and country) that desperation forged. We have a feeling that we join the Van der Linde gang in their final days, but nothing can prepare us for their agonizing falls, the stories they make along the way, or how we come to care for the damned and the doomed as if they were anything but.
It’s difficult to talk about Undertale’s story with absolute authority. That’s obviously partially due to the game’s complex themes and rather large narrative, but it’s really about how so much of Undertale‘s story plays out in the way you experience it. This is a game that constantly sets up new expectations only to immediately shatter them. A Wikipedia summary doesn’t do it justice, and the way you choose to play the game will affect your perception of it. 
What I can tell you with absolute authority is that Undertale is funny. That may sound like a strange thing to highlight in the context of the greatest gaming stories, but we don’t get a lot of genuinely funny games. Besides, few (if any) other games use humor to make us care for a game’s world, characters, and journey quite the way that Undertale does. The love this game’s adamant fans have for it is second to the love that went into making it.
Usually, hack-and-slash games focus on the hacking and slashing and tie events together with a barebones story that only exists to explain why the protagonist hacks and slashes. NieR Automata challenges that design.
NieR Automata begins with players controlling 2B: a combat android who exists to protect humanity from invading alien robots. The narrative is relatively simple at the start but quickly expands with themes such as identity, purpose, and camaraderie. Even when NieR Automata ends, the story isn’t over. In a twist few could say they ever saw coming, the New Game + mode offers a new perspective on previous events. Even after players are finished, New Game + offers a second New Game + mode, which adds even more context and story content, wrapping everything up in a satisfying, if humbling, finale.
Whether you love heavy pathos, lengthy campaigns, or stylish action, NieR Automata delivers a must-play experience.
With a fresh post-apocalyptic setting that mixes primitive humanity with visually stunning animalistic machines, it’s easy to get lured into Aloy’s journey just by how cool the game is to play. 
But Horizon isn’t afraid to introduce kindness and tragedy in equal measures early on. By mid-game, we’re invested in finding scraps of lore to tell us how humanity once lived and died at the hands of robots once meant to help us thrive. Framed by symbolic scraps of Egyptian mythology, Aloy’s mission to understand her predecessor, and to end the continuing horrors a bastard named Ted Faro set into motion, turns her into a protagonist we’re always happy to see more of.
A mysterious figure travels to a remote home in Washington to better understand the journal of a woman named Edith Finch. It seems that Edith belongs to a “cursed” family plagued by mysterious deaths. The stories of those deaths play out in highly stylized sequences that reflect the departed’s personality. The most memorable of those sequences sees a cannery worker’s increasingly elaborate daydreams lead to a brutal, yet necessarily realistic, depiction of suicide. 
Edith Finch is about the past, the future, and the often painful reconciliation that must be made between those concepts. Its offers horrors in the style of something like Hereditary, but you don’t have to look hard to find the strange beauty in its methods. We often look to the past to better understand ourselves and where we’re going, yet we so easily misremember and romanticize even the darkest moments in our lives. No other game grapples with that sensation quite like Edith Finch.
Tim Schaefer’s concept for Grim Fandango was a stroke of genius. This Maltese Falcon-style noir set in the Aztec vision of the afterlife is brimming with charismatic characters who transcend the genre archetypes they’re slotted into thanks to sharp, witty writing and voice acting, and iconic character designs that look great to this day. 
Manny Calavera and lovable lug Glottis’ four-year odyssey to save the pure-hearted Meche is full of deceit and deception, just like any other good noir. But it’s the game’s hilarious material, four-act structure, and imaginative riffs on noir and Day of the Dead imagery that set it apart as one of the most original and beloved adventure game stories ever.
Bioshock deserves a lot of credit for its fantastically well-crafted world that will really make you think long and hard about selfishness and the folly of utopianism. But what most people remember about the game are the three words: “Would you kindly?”
That one simple phrase puts Bioshock among the greatest gaming stories of all time. The great thing about it is that it’s dropped so sparingly and so casually at first, that you don’t even think much about it. It’s just a slightly old-fashioned phrase that fits in well with the game’s ‘60s style. But when you finally confront the game’s main antagonist Andrew Ryan and find out that it wasn’t harmless world-building, but actually a hypnotic trigger that controlled your actions for most of the game. It’s that perfect mind-bending twist that is genuinely shocking in the moment and recontextualizes an already incredible adventure. 
You are often the most important character in an RPG, and RPGs go to great lengths to remind you of that fact. Chosen ones, prophecies…numerous genre tropes exist to remind you why you are special. Well, New Vegas openly defies that trope. It goes out of its way to tell you that you’re not that special and not that important. What you do is up to you in a world that is clearly indifferent to chaos. 
Yet, New Vegas uses that idea to make you feel so much more important than you do in other RPGs. Because you have no fate but the one you make, every choice matters (at least to you) on some level. From the moment you create your character after being shot in the head and left for dead, you begin navigating a complex web of consequences where every action can have incredible and unexpected results. It’s a credit to New Vegas’ writing that all of those choices are not only expertly executed but always feel like the only story that matters.
“I think, therefore I AM.” The Harlan Ellison short story that inspired the video game adaptation of I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a deeply fascinating sci-fi dystopian epic that examines trauma and the resiliency of the human spirit in the most horrifying, demented ways. 
But the developers at Cyberdreams and The Dreamers Guild took the material to new heights by immersing players in the trauma of the characters and guiding them through their respective trials, all administered by sadistic supercomputer AM. This nearly 30-year-old adventure game remains a shining example of how video games can elevate and enhance stories in ways other mediums simply can’t.
Can a man ever truly change his ways and escape his violent past? It’s a heady topic for a fundamentally entertaining open-world game, but one that Red Dead Redemption tackles as well as the best Old West book or movie.
John Marston is a retired outlaw who simply wants to live in peace with his wife and son until federal agents pull him back into his old lifestyle to hunt his former gang members. While initially derided as “Grand Theft Auto with horses” simply because those games share a developer and large worlds, Red Dead Redemption is very much its own game, with an even better story than anything GTA has done. This is a historical epic about the inevitable march of progress, loss of freedom, and, ultimately, redemption.
With a handful of cutscenes, Shadow of the Colossus offers the barest outline of a story. A young man appeals to an imprisoned god to save a dead girl, and, chasing close behind, a mystic leads a band of warriors to stop the ritual. Despite its lack of overt storytelling elements, Shadow of the Colossus utilizes environmental storytelling to create something larger than life.
The Forbidden Lands are full of ruins that suggest a lost society. Dormin’s exhortations to kill the colossi beg questions with no firm answers. The dire warnings our narrator recites ask us to decide if he’s actually the hero here. The only keystone is its equally wordless connections to the preceding game ICO. Ultimately, each player lands on their own interpretation of these events. It’s magical in its silence.
Open-world games are known for their depth of content. The larger a game’s world, the more side quests and stories developers can fit into it. Well, The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt offers some of the densest narrative content per square inch you’ll ever find in such a game.
The narrative of The Witcher 3 is fairly simple: Players control Geralt as he searches for his adoptive daughter Ciri. Despite its simplicity, this main plot is well-written and full of equally compelling characters. Furthermore, the game is highly replayable because players can make tons of choices throughout their journey, which twists the plot in a myriad of unexpected ways.
However, the secret sauce of The Witcher 3 is its side content. The game is drowning in optional quests and stories that expand on the game world, and many of these bite-sized stories meet or even exceed the main narrative’s quality. It’s a narrative feat that sets an almost impossible standard for such titles.
Historically, the God of War games have always been known more for their action segments than their stories. That’s not to say their narratives were bad, just that they never matched the gameplay. The soft reboot changed that.
God of War (2018) follows Kratos fulfilling a dying request to spread his wife’s ashes from the highest peak in existence. The journey is complicated by the presence of Atreus and the even greater presence of the obvious emotional gap between father and son. The story quickly evolves into a gripping road trip-style story where Kratos has to not only come to connect with Atreus but also come to terms with his past and a future where he is no longer around to guide Atreus.
While God of War (2018) tells a solid story on its own, God of War veterans will get more out of it thanks to their firsthand knowledge of Kratos’ history. It’s an absolutely incredible recontextualization of the franchise’s mythos that feels like both a piece of a whole and the clear standout.
There are so many things that make Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic a great Star Wars story. The characters are rough around the edges and relatable, such as the internally conflicted Bastila Shan and the morally gray Jolee Bindo, and traversing the galaxy on the Ebon Hawk makes the game feel decidedly on-brand. It is as incredible of a Star Wars tale as we can ask for in all the ways we typically look at and judge Star Wars tales.
All of the classic Star Wars elements are here, but let’s be honest. What makes this particular space opera stand out from the rest is the earth-shattering plot twist, which alters the DNA of the story completely. It’s not just one of the best surprises in Star Wars franchise history; it’s one of the best twists in gaming history, and it’s the main reason BioWare’s modern classic is held in high regard by fans to this day.
Portal 2 is a masterclass on how complex storytelling can be applied to even the simplest concepts. The rogue AI GLaDOS was already an iconic character by the end of the first Portal, but turning her into an unlikely partner (in the form of a potato), somehow made her even better in the sequel, while Wheatley’s incompetence makes him an even more intimidating villain. 
And who could forget J.K. Simmons’ pitch-perfect vocal performance as Aperture CEO Cave Johnson? While giving plenty of backstory on what led to the events of Portal, his monologue about lemons is one of the greatest ever written for any game. This is the rare game that will have you laughing out loud until the very end, yet it’s the hints of grander mythos and shocking emotional beats that will stay with you long after the laughs have faded.
Many games have morality systems, but they usually only affect the surface of the experience (such as character skills or potential allies). However, Planescape: Torment doesn’t just use a morality system. It orbits around one to ask its central narrative question, “What can change the nature of a man?”
Planescape: Torment stars the Nameless One: an amnesiac who wakes up in a mortuary. He has no idea of who he was or why he was mistaken for a corpse, and while the trope of an amnesiac protagonist is overused, for the Nameless One, it is woven into his identity. He is a blank slate that players can mold, surrounded by charming and witty characters who change with him.
At its core, Planescape: Torment is one big mystery. Who was the Nameless One previously? Can you trust the people around him? Can you even trust the Nameless One? Every new plot twist answers some questions but asks new ones, and some even make you reconsider whether you can even believe previous revelations. The sheer scope and worldbuilding of Planescape: Torment only accentuate the narrative, resulting in a title that will leave players wanting more while second-guessing every decision.
Come to Revachol for the mental illness and crippling alcoholism! Stay for its Rorschach-style method of introspection, where every decision you make as the player may end up saying more about you than the wasted detective you’re puppeting!
Cheekily aware of the real world we live in, Disco Elysium imbues its fictional society with fantastical quirks to distract us from its sharp-edged commentary. That is until we realize we’re totally hooked on the plot.
Our protagonist is a cop: an ironic choice to lead a story about one man’s praxis in a world shattered by ideologues of all kinds. He has a job to do, despite the interpretations we put on his personality, and it’s about much more than a lynching behind a union bar. We’re given plenty to think about as we speak with capitalist cronies and opportunistic comrades. Though its plot is linear, there are multiple unique ways to progress, making it into a story we’ll be happy to replay for years to come.
Whenever the subject of why people love horror so much is discussed, the idea that people “enjoy being scared” inevitably comes up. There is obviously some truth to that, but you get the feeling that the people who say that are talking about funhouse scares. Things that go “boo!” and give us a quick thrill. It’s not that the same idea doesn’t apply to deeper, darker, more psychological forms of horror but rather that the interpretation of that idea is different. What if we don’t love being scared so much as we secretly crave some kind of punishment? 
That is one of the many thematic ideas explored in Silent Hill 2. As Harry Mason, you follow a letter from your seemingly dead wife into the depths of the town of Silent Hill. There, you will experience a truly masterful blend of pre-set and dynamic narrative concepts. 
Silent Hill 2 doesn’t make Henry Mason a blank slate. He has his own personality, his own story, and his own fears. Indeed we watch those fears manifest themselves throughout the town and take the form of various monsters and other horrors. However, Silent Hill 2 is very much our own story. How you choose to play the game is reflected in the story in subtle ways that most players will never realize during the course of the game. Thoughts of suicide, sexual repression, a desire to undo the past…it’s so difficult to untangle the knot that binds Harry Mason to the player that some may find more peace in accepting that the connection is too strong to properly be broken.
At its core, Chrono Trigger is a surprisingly straightforward story about time travel and saving the world, but it’s just so incredibly well told that it has carved out a special place in gaming history.
Part of the game’s magic is in the eras you visit, which range from the prehistoric and the medieval to the far-flung future, and, eventually, the very end of the world. Through it all, we come to know and love Chrono Trigger‘s incredible cast of characters. Frog is just such a tragic hero, and then there’s the completely optional Magus redemption arc. 
And then the whole thing wraps up with one of 13 different endings; an impressive accomplishment for the time that has lost little power over the years. Regardless of which ending you get, the story feels like it’s come to a satisfying conclusion. It’s rare for a game to include so much optional content, and for it all to be so well written and tied together so perfectly. And that’s really the ultimate genius of Chrono Trigger. Even with its lofty narrative goals, it remains incredibly well-paced and focused, ultimately resulting in a masterpiece of a story that appropriately stands the test of time.
The greatest testament to the power of The Last of Us’ story is that the very best scenes from the mega-hit HBO TV adaptation were ripped shot for shot, word for word, directly from the game. The fact that a video game story from 2013 has been proven, without a shadow of a doubt, to be as good as, if not better than, any prestige drama you’ll find on TV or the big screen a decade after its initial release is astounding.
All of the franchise’s success is thanks to Neil Druckmann and the team at Naughty Dog, who crafted a timeless lone-wolf-and-cub tale that explores the most grotesque yet relatable aspects of human nature in the most poetic way. Joel and Ellie are the most layered, psychologically complex, fully-realized video game protagonists ever created. As their relationship develops over the course of their odyssey toward “the light,” we get to know them and their deepest fears so intimately that, when the game’s tragic finale comes, we’re shocked, but we also understand precisely where they’re both coming from.
It’ll be hard for any game to top The Last of Us’ story, but what’s exciting is that it has raised the bar for the medium and will influence and inspire the evolution of storytelling in games for years to come.
The world that we live in today is dominated by advertising. Adverts are on television, on the World Wide Web, in the street and even on our mobile phones. However, many of the strategies used to sell a product or service can be considered immoral or unacceptable.
To begin with, the fact that we cannot escape from advertising is a significant cause for complaint. Constant images and signs wherever we look can be very intrusive and irritating at times. Take for example advertising on the mobile phone. With the latest technology mobile companies are now able to send advertising messages via SMS to consumers' phones whenever they choose. Although we expect adverts in numerous situations, it now seems that there are very few places we can actually avoid them.
A further aspect of advertising that I would consider unethical is the way that it encourages people to buy products they may not need or cannot afford. Children and young people in particular are influenced by adverts showing the latest toys, clothing or music and this can put enormous pressure on the parents to buy these products.
In addition, the advertising of tobacco products and alcohol has long been a controversial issue, but cigarette adverts have only recently been banned in many countries. It is quite possible that alcohol adverts encourage excessive consumption and underage drinking, yet restrictions have not been placed on this type of advertising in the same way as smoking. 
It is certainly true to say that advertising is an everyday feature of our lives. Therefore, people are constantly being encouraged to buy products or services that might be too expensive, unnecessary or even unhealthy. In conclusion, many aspects of advertising do appear to be morally wrong and are not acceptable in today's society.
Alternative medicine is not new. It is accepted that it pre-dates conventional medicine and it is still used by many people all over the world. I am unconvinced that it is dangerous, and feel that both alternative and conventional medicine can be useful.
There are several reasons why the conventional medical community is often dismissive of alternatives.  Firstly, there has been little scientific research into such medicine, so there is a scarcity of evidence to support the claims of their supporters. Furthermore, people often try such treatment because of recommendations from friends, and therefore come to the therapist with a very positive attitude, which may be part of the reason for the cure. Moreover, these therapies are usually only useful for long-term, chronic conditions. Acute medical problems, such as accidental injury, often require more conventional methods.
On the other hand, there remain strong arguments for the use of alternatives.  Despite the lack of scientific proof, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that these therapies work. In addition, far from being dangerous, they often have few or no side effects, so the worst outcome would be no change. One of the strongest arguments for the effectiveness of alternative therapies in the West is that, whilst conventional medicine is available without charge, many people are prepared to pay considerable sums for alternatives. If they were totally unhelpful, it would be surprising if this continued.
I strongly believe that conventional medicine and alternative therapies can and should coexist. They have different strengths, and can both be used effectively to target particular medical problems. The best situation would be for alternative therapies to be used to support and complement conventional medicine.
These days, the government spends a large part of its budget not only on public services, but also the arts. Although I agree that it is important to spend money on public services, I do not think spending additionally on the arts is a waste of money.
There are several reasons for spending a significant amount of the government budget on public services. First and foremost, public services are the things such as hospitals, roads and schools, and these things determine the quality of life that most of us will have. For example, if the government does not spend enough money on hospitals, the health of our society may decline. Similarly, if not enough money is spent on schools, our children may not be properly educated. Also, it will be the poor in our society that will be affected more if we do not spend enough on these things because they are the ones more dependent on such services.
However, this does not mean that the arts should be completely neglected. To begin, it is difficult for many arts institutions to generate much profit, so without some help from the government, many theatres and other such places may have to close. Moreover, the arts also have an important impact on our quality of life. Many people get great pleasure in going to see music and theatre performances so it is important that the government assists such institutions so that they can continue to provide entertainment to the public.
To sum up, there are clear benefits of ensuring a large amount of investment goes into public services as this influences the quality of life for nearly all of us. That said, I do not believe spending money on the arts is a waste of money as this too provides important benefits.
The cloning of animals has been occurring for a number of years now, and this has now opened up the possibility of cloning humans too. Although there are clear benefits to humankind of cloning to provide spare body parts, I believe it raises a number of worrying ethical issues.
Due to breakthroughs in medical science and improved diets, people are living much longer than in the past. This, though, has brought with it problems. As people age, their organs can fail so they need replacing. If humans were cloned, their organs could then be used to replace those of sick people. It is currently the case that there are often not enough organ donors around to fulfil this need, so cloning humans would overcome the issue as there would then be a ready supply.
However, for good reasons, many people view this as a worrying development. Firstly, there are religious arguments against it. It would involve creating other human beings and then eventually killing them in order to use their organs, which it could be argued is murder. This is obviously a sin according to religious texts. Also, dilemmas would arise over what rights these people have, as surely they would be humans just like the rest of us. Furthermore, if we have the ability to clone humans, it has to be questioned where this cloning will end. Is it then acceptable for people to start cloning relatives or family members who have died?
To conclude, I do not agree with this procedure due to the ethical issues and dilemmas it would create. Cloning animals has been a positive development, but this is where it should end.
It is evident that, at present, people are spending a considerable amount of time on the Internet, and thus spending less time with real people. I strongly agree that although this use of the Internet has greatly increased the level of communication available, it has also had detrimental effects on the amount and type of social interaction that takes place.
The benefits of the Internet in terms of increased communication are clear, with people connected across the globe. In the past, communication was only possible by phone or mail, which entailed time and expense. It also usually meant just keeping in contact with those people already known to you. With the internet, this has changed dramatically. Email and social networking sites such as Facebook and MSN have created online communities that are global in scale, and they have fostered communication between people and countries that we would not have thought possible in the not too distant past.
That said, there is no doubt in my mind that this has had negative impacts on social interaction. People, especially the younger generation, spend hours of their time online, chatting and on forums. Although this can be beneficial, it is certainly not the same as real interaction with human beings and does not involve the same skills. It is important that children have and maintain real friendships in order to develop their own interpersonal skills. Not only this, it can also have negative effects on local communities if people are spending most of their time communicating online and not mixing in their neighbourhoods, and possibly lead to feelings of isolation for those individuals who do not have a ‘real’ person to turn to in times of need.
To conclude, I believe that the internet has undoubtedly been beneficial, but there are good reasons to be concerned about social interaction in our societies. It is therefore important that we maintain a balance between our online life and our contact with real human beings.
Over recent years there has been an enormous increase in the amount of air traffic around the world resulting in various problems, and a major cause of this has been the growth of low-cost airlines. Although some people believe that taxes should be increased for air travel, I disagree.
Those that support taxing airlines believe that this will result in a reduction in this type of travel and thus solve the problems of pollution, noise and construction. This is because a tax would make the cost of travelling more expensive, which will, they claim, lead to a decrease in demand. Proponents of this solution believe that taxes are fair because everyone has to pay them and it is a workable solution that will have the additional bonus of providing an income for the government.
However, there are a number of reasons why this is not the right course of action. Firstly, a tax is not fair because it will adversely affect people on lower incomes. Such a tax would have to be a fixed amount paid equally whether you are rich or poor, which means that those on lower incomes would find it more difficult to travel, but it would likely have little effect on the lives of those with a higher income. In addition, such a tax would not work. For example, we have seen taxes increase in most countries on cars, but this has had little affect, with car use continuing to grow.
To sum up, it is evident that introducing heavy taxes on air travel is not fair or workable. If we continue to explore alternatives, we can continue to enjoy the benefits that air travel offers.
Over recent years, more and more people have been attending university and arguments have persisted as to whether students should pay for this privilege not. Although there are convincing arguments on both sides, I strongly believe that it should be free.
One argument put forward in favour of charging students is that education is becoming more expensive to fund as universities grow in size. Consequently, making students pay may maintain standards and ensure the quality of the teaching. In addition, it is argued that most students benefit from university in terms of higher paid jobs, so it is fair that they pay for at least some of the cost, especially given that the majority of students attending university are from the middle classes. Last but not least, in many countries, there is a shortage of people to do manual jobs such as plumbing and carpentry, so making university more expensive may encourage people to take up these jobs.
However, there are a number of arguments in favour of making university education free for all. Firstly, it will encourage more people to attend and this will benefit society. This is because it will lead to a more productive and educated workforce. Research has generally shown that those countries that have a better educated population via university have higher levels of innovation and productivity. In addition, there is the issue of equality of opportunity. If all students are required to pay, those on a low income may be dissuaded from attending, thus making it unfair. The reason for this is that they will likely not be able to secure financial support from their family so they will be concerned about the debts they will incur in the future.
In conclusion, I am of opinion that all education should remain equally available to all regardless of income. This is not only fair, but will also ensure that countries can prosper and develop into the future with a well-educated workforce.
Undertaking scientific research is imperative if countries want to progress and compete in a globalized world. However, the funding and controlling of this research remain contentious issues. In my opinion, the government should have the predominant responsibility for these.
One of the first issues is the knowledge that we gain from research. If governments are responsible then they are driven by the need to make advances in knowledge in order to improve people’s lives. This is because they are accountable to the public and the research is paid for by taxes. On the other hand, private organizations are driven by profit. This may mean that some research that could be valuable to society may not begin because there is no monetary gain.
Another issue related to this is the research process. When the funding for research comes from the same organization that is going to gain from a favorable outcome, there is a strong potential for biased results. Taking drugs companies as an example, legislation usually requires rigorous trials for new drugs that can take many years to complete. The companies have large amounts of money invested in such research and the need for positive results is paramount. It is difficult for a scientist to remain impartial in these circumstances. However, if this is controlled and funded by governments, their accountability means that such conflicts of interest are less likely to occur.
On balance, I would argue that although it is not realistic to remove all opportunities for privately funded research, governments should have the main responsibility for the monitoring and controlling of this. Strong checks and balances need to be in place to ensure future research is ethical and productive.
Medical studies have shown that smoking not only leads to health problems for the smoker, but also for people close by. As a result of this, many believe that smoking should not be allowed in public places. Although there are arguments on both sides, I strongly agree that a ban is the most appropriate course of action.
Opponents of such a ban argue against it for several reasons. Firstly, they say that passive smokers make the choice to breathe in other people’s smoke by going to places where it is allowed. If they would prefer not to smoke passively, then they do not need to visit places where smoking is permitted. In addition, they believe a ban would possibly drive many bars and pubs out of business as smokers would not go there anymore. They also argue it is a matter of freedom of choice. Smoking is not against the law, so individuals should have the freedom to smoke where they wish.
However, there are more convincing arguments in favour of a ban. First and foremost, it has been proven that tobacco consists of carcinogenic compounds which cause serious harm to a person’s health, not only the smoker. Anyone around them can develop cancers of the lungs, mouth and throat, and other sites in the body. It is simply not fair to impose this upon another person. It is also the case that people’s health is more important than businesses. In any case, pubs and restaurants could adapt to a ban by, for example, allowing smoking areas.
In conclusion, it is clear that it should be made illegal to smoke in public places. This would improve the health of thousands of people, and that is most definitely a positive development.
Some people claim that due to the rapid changes occurring in modern work places, it is better to employ younger than older people. I do not believe that this is the case.
One argument in support of younger employees is that older employees could be more set in their ways and potentially against any change. To an extent this may be true, but there are many flexible and intelligent workers over 50, while there are inflexible and narrow-minded younger ones. Attitude towards change is a result not of age but of personality type.
That said, physical changes occurring with age could mean certain jobs are more suited to a younger person. For instance, psychologists seem to be in agreement that memory declines with age for people not remaining mentally active. In high-tech industries such as computer programming, where it is so important to be able to work with so much information, numbers and calculations, being younger may be an advantage.
However, older workers have a wide range of other positive attributes that they can bring to their working environment. Generally, they have more work experience than those who are younger. In addition, as can be seen with the trend of many department stores in the UK to take on older people, they are seen to be more reliable and respectful. These are important in any kind of working environment.
In conclusion, therefore, there is not the evidence to support employing young people as opposed to those over 50. It would seem that a mix of the best qualities of old and young is preferential in order to ensure the most productive environment evolves.
Vegetarianism is becoming more and more popular for many people, particularly because of the harm that some people believe meat can cause to the body. However, I strongly believe that it is not necessary for everybody to be a vegetarian.
Vegetarians believe that meat is unhealthy because of the diseases it has been connected with. There has been much research to suggest that red meat is particularly bad, for example, and that consumption should be limited to eating it just a few times a week to avoid such things as cancer. Meats can also be high in saturated fats so they have been linked to health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
However, there are strong arguments for eating meat. The first reason is that as humans we are designed to eat meat, which suggests it is not unhealthy, and we have been eating meat for thousands of years. For example, cavemen made hunting implements so that they could kill animals and eat their meat. Secondly, meat is a rich source of protein which helps to build muscles and bones. Vegetarians often have to take supplements to get all the essential vitamins and minerals. Finally, it may be the case that too much meat is harmful, but we can easily limit the amount we have without having to cut it out of our diet completely.
To sum up, I do not agree that everyone should turn to a vegetarian diet. Although the overconsumption of meat could possibly be unhealthy, a balanced diet of meat and vegetables should result in a healthy body.
People work hard and earn money which ideally they would like to retain for themselves. However, a significant portion of this usually has to be given to the state. In my view, it is right that people pay their fair share of taxes. 
Money is everything in today’s world. This is because money is used to buy all the necessities such as food, water, and shelter. Money is also used to help a family’s children in the form of school fees and other activities. In addition to this, people do not only need money to cater for their necessities, but also for future investments. The more that people have to invest, the more they believe they can accumulate in the long term. As a result, many are reluctant to lose some of their income through the deduction of tax. 
Nevertheless, citizens should be obliged to pay taxes to the government for a number of reasons. They should accept that the taxes they pay help the government offer them the public services all over the country. These public services are things such as the construction of roads, bridges, public hospitals, parks and other public services. The same tax money helps the country’s economy to be stable. Through taxes, the government can also pay off its debts. In short, money received through taxes is a way of ensuring that people have comfortable livelihoods.
In conclusion, even though many people think that they should not pay taxes, that money is useful to the stability of any country. Therefore, people should not avoid paying taxes as it may affect the country’s economy and services that it provides. 
Many educational establishments such as schools and universities are choosing to assess their students through course work and projects undertaken during term time rather than the traditional examinations. Continual assessment can be an effective way to evaluate student’s abilities, but formal examinations should also be maintained.
There are two principal benefits of formal examinations. Firstly, they are a fair system as every student has an equal opportunity since they all sit the same exam at the same time, meaning that those students who work hard should be rewarded with a high grade. In addition to this, it is also difficult to cheat if the exam is properly invigilated.  However, some students naturally excel in exams, whereas others find it difficult to work under these stressful and time-constrained conditions. Formal exams, may not, therefore, always reflect a student’s true ability.
Continual assessment, on the other hand, allows those students who work at a slower pace more time to work on their course work and projects.  The teacher can also observe and assist students who may be weaker, thus providing them with the opportunity to improve during the term. Not only this, projects encourage team work, an important skill that is necessary for future employment. Focusing only on formal exams may mean that this important component of children’s development is not seen as important by teachers or students.
To conclude, it is evident that both continual assessment and formal examinations are effective in different ways, but they also have weaknesses. I would therefore argue that in order to have robust evaluation procedures in the future, both should be used to assess students during their education.Multinational organisations can be found in most major cities around the world these days. Although working for such a company provides the opportunity to mix with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, I would argue that this is not necessarily the best way to learn about other cultures.  
There is no doubt that for some people, working for a multinational organisation will enhance their understanding of other cultures. The first reason is that in a multinational organisation one can learn about the customs and traditions of other countries through mixing with people from different backgrounds who work in the company or in liaising with colleagues abroad. Exposure to other languages is also likely, something that gives a much greater depth of understanding of a culture. There may also be the chance to relocate to work in another country, which would mean complete immersion in that culture.
However, there are a number of reasons that it is not necessarily the best way. Firstly, there is no guarantee that you will be a person who gets such exposure to other cultures as it depends on your position within the company. Not all employees have roles where they regularly mix with other cultures. Also, there are also other excellent ways to achieve such a goal. For example, many people these days travel the world, and this is an opportunity to meet and spend time with people from other countries. It is also possible to do voluntary work with organisations and charities that work in other countries, something that would mean you meet a mix of people rather than just those who work in companies. 
In conclusion, despite the potential ways in which working for a multinational company can result in contact with people from other cultures, I believe that it cannot be assumed it is the best way as there are other options to do this.  
It is common at the present time to see people getting updates on the latest news from the internet rather than the traditional method of reading a newspaper. I would argue that electronic sources of news will gradually replace that of the newspaper. 
Newspapers remain an important source of news for several reasons.  The first of these is that the older generation still prefer to read their news this way, which is because they have traditionally bought a newspaper over the years and so do not wish to change or simply do not know how to do so online in some cases. In addition to this a newspaper also comes with other supplements, such as magazines and television guides, and sources of entertainment, such as crosswords. This makes it more attractive for some than going online.  
However, though newspapers may not disappear completely, the Internet is likely to become the more dominant source of news over time. This is primarily because younger people tend to read the news online and prefer not to pay for it, so those reading newspapers, the older generations, will gradually decline. This links in with the second reason, which is that as media companies start to see a drop income from newspapers, printing them will become unprofitable and they will be forced to find ways to make money from news online. 
In conclusion, although newspapers remain popular today, they will gradually be replaced by the desire to read the news through electronic sources. This may be a sad loss given their history, but unfortunately it is an unavoidable development. 
Developments in technology over many years have dramatically changed the world that we live in, and some people think that earlier advances in technology have had a greater impact on and been more beneficial to the lives of ordinary people than more recent changes. However, I partially agree with this as the advantages and influences on people’s lives actually depends on the particular area of technology.
There is no doubt that some earlier advances in technology have been very influential, such as those related to technology around the home. Devices such as washing machines, fridges and freezers, central heating, microwaves and televisions were invented many years ago, and now nearly every household has all or some of these in their home, making life much easier. Though they have been improved over time, they still carry out much the same purpose as when they were first invented. 
Another example is that of medicine. Despite the fact that there have been ground-breaking recent medical developments, such as that connected to research into genes and stem cells, the benefits to the average person are still many years away. The most influential impacts on health have been earlier technological developments of the past, which remain today. These are the ability to treat so many injuries and diseases and carry out organ transplants in hospitals. It is these that have benefits on so many lives and will for decades to come. 
However, if we look at some more recent developments, they have had a much greater influence than in the past. For instance, there is the phone, which was a significant development when invented helping many people. However, although invented many years ago, technological developments over the last few decades have enabled the phone to now be mobile and connected to the internet. This has had incredible impacts on the way people Iive their lives with people using phones for so many everyday activities and for connecting around the world.
In conclusion, I would argue that although some older technological developments are important, some new ones are too. The impacts on ordinary people’s lives therefore depends on the type of technology in question.
There are thousands  of languages in the world today. Some of them are strong languages spoken by many millions of people, while others are spoken by smaller groups of people, sometimes numbering in the hundreds. As languages die, benefits accrue to human society, but also drawbacks. It is certainly not advantageous for everybody everywhere.
From a practical point of view, having fewer languages can lead to greater ease in communication. This is because when people share a language, then information and ideas can flow more easily, which is of utmost importance in a globalised world. In addition, there is an economic advantage, or economies of scale, since information can be presented in written form in greater bulk, meaning there is no need for translations, which can be costly. Thus, internationally, the flow of ideas and information is facilitated through the common language.
There is another side, though. First of all, those who have lost a language have also lost a culture, a way of expressing themselves, and a way of understanding the world and their experience of the world. They will never be able to express themselves fully in their new language. Secondly, the quality of communication in the common language is limited. The reason for this is that people are writing and reading in an acquired language, not the mother tongue. Also, this acquired language may simply be unable to express some of the culturally-bound ideas of the non-native speaker.
In brief, then, language death is a tragedy. Those whose language dies lose part of their identity, and a way to give expression to their deep thoughts and feelings. For the rest of the world, there is a loss of diversity. Along with the language, a whole culture and way of expressing this culture die. Things of deep human value that could be expressed before are now silenced.
It is commonly known that many species have gone extinct throughout history, including the dinosaurs. Some argue that preventing extinction is not necessary, as it is a natural process. However, I believe that humans have a moral obligation to protect endangered species and prevent their extinction.
Firstly, human activities such as deforestation, overfishing, and pollution have caused a rapid decline in animal populations, leading many species to be at risk of extinction. As a result, humans have a responsibility to conserve the environment and prevent further harm to wildlife. It is unfair for humans to cause the extinction of a species due to their actions, particularly when they have the ability to prevent it.
Another reason is that many species play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. For example, bees are essential pollinators that are responsible for pollinating 80% of flowering plants, and thus if bees were to become extinct, it would have a devastating impact on our food supply and ecosystem. Similarly, the loss of predators can cause a ripple effect, leading to overpopulation of other species and causing imbalances in the food chain.
Lastly, preventing extinction is not only a matter of responsibility but also a matter of morality. Species have intrinsic value, and it is not our place to determine which species should exist and which should not. Humans must respect the inherent value of all life forms and do what they can to protect them.
In conclusion, while extinction may be a natural process, it is not a justification for humans to sit idly by and watch as countless species go extinct. By taking action to conserve the environment, humans can ensure that future generations can enjoy the same diversity of life that we have today.
In any relationship, the importance of truthfulness is a topic that often sparks debates. While some argue that always telling the truth is the most crucial aspect, I believe that the significance of truthfulness should be considered in relation to other factors. 
Undoubtedly, honesty plays a vital role in fostering trust and building strong connections between people. When individuals are truthful with each other, it establishes a foundation of transparency and integrity. This creates a sense of security and allows for open communication, which is essential for healthy relationships.
However, it is essential to recognise that truthfulness is not an absolute concept and must be balanced with other considerations. In certain situations, revealing the complete truth can be harmful or unnecessary. For example, when delivering bad news, such as a terminal illness diagnosis, it is crucial to consider the emotional well-being of the recipient. While honesty should be prioritised, the delivery of information must be done with sensitivity.
Furthermore, maintaining trust in a relationship involves more than just truthfulness. In some cases, withholding the truth may be necessary to protect the well-being of the other person or the relationship itself. If, for instance, someone asks you about a new hairstyle they have, it could be damaging to the relationship to tell them you do not like it, so a white lie may be the best option to avoid hurting them. Thus factors such as respect, empathy, and understanding also contribute significantly.
In conclusion, while truthfulness is important in relationships, it should be considered in conjunction with other factors. Balancing truthfulness with empathy, sensitivity to the situation, and the overall well-being of the relationship is crucial and promotes healthier and more harmonious relationships.
The role of schools in shaping the future generation has been a subject of debate for decades. While some argue that schools should primarily focus on moulding children into responsible citizens and productive workers, others claim that the individual development of students should take precedence. 
There is merit in the belief that schools should prioritise instilling qualities that contribute to aspects of citizenship and work. Good education plays a pivotal role in cultivating a sense of civic responsibility, fostering values such as honesty, empathy, and social awareness. Promoting these values is clearly desirable as they could perhaps reduce social issues, such as crime and anti-social behaviour. Moreover, a workforce consisting of diligent and productive individuals drives economic growth and prosperity, again an important benefit for all.
However, focusing solely on societal benefits neglects essential aspects of child development. Young children these days appear to be experiencing higher levels of mental health, such as depression and eating disorders, meaning it is critical to do what is necessary to help each child feel confident within themselves and able to cope with the world we live in today. Schools should, therefore, strive to create an environment that encourages self-discovery and personal growth. Furthermore, personal fulfilment leads to happier, more engaged citizens who are more likely to participate actively in society without schools having to specifically set out to achieve this.
In conclusion, while the goal of schools should indeed involve shaping responsible citizens and productive workers, this objective should not overshadow the significance of individual development. Balancing both aspects ensures that students not only contribute positively to society but also experience personal growth and fulfilment.
The repatriation of historical objects and artefacts to their countries of origin has sparked intense debates. While I acknowledge the importance of preserving a nation's heritage and cultural identity, I believe that the decision to return these items should be made with careful consideration of various factors.
Firstly, repatriation can serve as a means to restore a sense of cultural pride and identity. Objects that hold historical and cultural significance often represent the heart of a nation's heritage, and their return can contribute to the enrichment of local communities. For instance, the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece from the British Museum could enhance Greek citizens' connection to their ancient past, fostering a deeper appreciation for their own cultural roots.
However, the process of repatriation is not devoid of complexities. Museums and institutions that currently house these artefacts often argue that they have been responsible for their preservation, and returning them might jeopardise their conservation. Moreover, in cases where historical objects have been acquired through legal means or during times of colonial expansion, determining rightful ownership can be challenging. Repatriation could also hinder cultural exchange and global appreciation of history by limiting access to these objects from people around the world.
Striking a balance between repatriation and the preservation of global cultural heritage is crucial. Instead of blanket repatriation policies, collaboration between countries of origin and current custodians could be a more effective approach. This could involve temporary loans, joint exhibitions, or digital platforms to facilitate the sharing of information and knowledge about these objects.
In conclusion, while I agree that the return of historical objects and artefacts to their countries of origin can contribute positively to cultural identity, I also believe that a nuanced approach is necessary, with a focus on collaboration and compromise.
The concept of reducing the income gap between the rich and the poor is often associated with the creation of a happier society. I partially agree with this sentiment, as closing the income disparity has significant implications for societal well-being, although it is not the sole determinant of happiness.
To begin with, a narrowing income gap can address many root causes of social dissatisfaction. When wealth is more evenly distributed, it can lead to improved access to essential services such as healthcare, education, and housing for those at the lower end of the economic spectrum. This access empowers individuals, improves their quality of life, and can lead to higher levels of satisfaction and happiness. Additionally, a smaller income gap reduces feelings of inequality and injustice, fostering social cohesion and reducing societal tensions.
Moreover, reducing income inequality can have positive economic outcomes. It can lead to greater consumer spending and economic growth, as a larger portion of the population has disposable income to contribute to the economy. Such economic stability may contribute to a general sense of well-being and happiness within society.
However, economic equality alone does not automatically result in a happier society. Other factors, such as political stability, cultural values, social networks, and personal freedom, play crucial roles in determining overall happiness. Additionally, an overemphasis on income redistribution without addressing underlying issues such as economic productivity and innovation can have negative consequences, such as reduced incentives for hard work and entrepreneurship.
In conclusion, while reducing the income gap can contribute to societal happiness by enhancing equality and access to essential resources, it must be part of a broader strategy that includes addressing other factors impacting well-being. Only then can a truly happier society be achieved.
